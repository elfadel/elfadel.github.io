I am a Cloud RAN Engineer at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en) where I am taking a part in the [CloudRAN](https://bit.ly/3z7JJRA) innovations. In 2021, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at [Orange Labs](https://www.orange.com/en) where I focused on the acceleration of 5G network functions by eBPF/XDP technology in NFV infrastructures. My research interests are 5G Network, AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning), Programmables Control and Data planes, P4 language, NFV/SDN.
I earned my Ph.D. in Telecommunication and Computer Science at [INSA-Toulouse](https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/fr/index.html), under the supervision of [Christophe Chassot](https://homepages.laas.fr/chassot/pmwiki/pmwiki.php) and [Samir Medjiah](https://www.laas.fr/public/annuaire?userid=18283). During my Ph.D., I was affiliated with [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr/public/en) and have worked on a stable software architecture for conception, implementation, and deployment of Internet communication protocols.
