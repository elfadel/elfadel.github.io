My mantra: learn, share, and loop. What? Every tech subjects.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Passionate about techs, I have acquired advanced skills in cloud architecture and infrastructure automation through the use of GitOps and DevOps tools and principles. During last year, I built a strong technical background skills covering several areas: Cloud, AI, mobile networks (5G & 6G), Linux programming, etc.

I also enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience as an IT trainer and mentor. I've contributed to many open-source projects and published several technical and scientific articles.
